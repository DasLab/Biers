Best Inference Engine for RNA Structure

Note: This package is still under development!
------

This package is a set of MATLAB scripts that wrap around the RNAstructure suite of executables to infer secondary structure models guided by chemical mapping data. Features include:
* Secondary structure modeling guided by SHAPE and DMS probing, as well as data from mutate-and-map experiments.
* Secondary structure modeling guided by MOHCA data.
* Calculation of helix-wise confidence values using bootstrapping.
* Plotting utilities using MATLAB and VARNA.
* 

Installation
------
To install, clone this repository and add the path to your MATLAB path. Then, go to the get_exe_dir.m and change the path to match your RNAstructure/exe directory.
