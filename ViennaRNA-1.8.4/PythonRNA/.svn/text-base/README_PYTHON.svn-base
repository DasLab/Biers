To get python wrappers for your system you will need to build a _RNA.so module
for your particular system using swig. This can be done in this directory
with the following commands

$ swig -python RNA.i
$ python setup.py build_ext --inplace

[Before doing this, make sure you have compiled ViennaRNA first.]
If you get that the linker does not find the libRNA library, try modifying
the library line of setup.py like so:

RNA_module = Extension('_RNA',
                           sources=['RNA_wrap.c'],
			   library_dirs=[ '../'],
			   libraries=['libRNA'],#sometimes you'll have to use libraries=['RNA'] instead (e.g. for linux)
                           )

After that, you should have a _RNA.so that is the wrapper to the RNA library functions of Vienna.
In this directory, check that you can import the RNA module correctly:

$ python -c "import RNA"

If all goes well, you should be able to call the RNA library functions via the RNA module.
Add this directory to your PYTHONPATH to use it wherever you please.
